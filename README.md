# After Dark Quotes screensaver
This is the remake of an old screensaver I used to love when I was young. It displays quotes randomly on the screen.

Of course, like the original, quotes and time between quotes can be changed

You can check out a sample of it [here](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/adquotes/).

## Customize the script
To change the quotes and other options, open the file `options.js` and follow the instructions.
