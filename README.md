# After Dark Quotes screensaver
This is the remake of an old screensaver I used to love when I was young. It displays quotes randomly on the screen.

Of course, like the original, quotes and time between quotes can be changed

You can check out a sample of it [here](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/adquotes/).

## Customize the script
To change the quotes, open the file `quotes.js` and simply replace the quotes you want with your text. To add more quotes (as many as you want!!) just add a line like `"",` and put the text between the "s. Don't forget the `,` at the end of each line *except for the last one!!*

To change some additionnal options, open `options.js` and follow the instructions.
