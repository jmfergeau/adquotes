# Say No More CSS/JS screensaver
This is the remake of the After Dark screensaver "Say What?" by Jim Miars, an old screensaver I used to love when I was young. It displays quotes randomly on the screen.

Of course, like the original, quotes and time between quotes can be changed. Some additionnal parameters have been added like the choice of borders styles and colors. It's made by default to behave like the original but you can change more things than before.

You can check out a sample of it [here](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/adquotes/).

## Customize the script
To change the quotes and other options, open the file `options.js` and follow the instructions.
