# Say No More CSS/JS screensaver
This is the remake of the After Dark screensaver "Say What?" by Jim Miars, an old screensaver I used to love when I was young. It displays quotes randomly on the screen. You can actually use it with [Before Dawn](https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn)!

Of course, like the original, quotes and time between quotes can be changed. Some additionnal parameters have been added like the choice of borders styles and colors. It's made by default to behave like the original but you can change more things than before.

You can check out a sample of it [here](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/adquotes/).

## Using it with Before Dawn
- Download the source code.
- Put it inside a folder in the folder that holds your screensavers.
- To edit the quotes used, open the file `quotes.js` and follow the instructions.
- Open Before Dawn settings and select the "Say No More" screensaver.
- You can change the settings in the Before Dawn window.

## Using it as standalone web page
- To edit the quotes used, open the file quotes.js and follow the instructions.
- To change the other options, open the file `options.js` and follow the instructions.
