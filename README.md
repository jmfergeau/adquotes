# Say No More CSS/JS screensaver
This is the remake of the After Dark screensaver "Say What?" by Jim Miars, an old screensaver I used to love when I was young. It displays quotes randomly on the screen. You can actually use it with [Before Dawn](https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn)!

Of course, like the original, quotes and time between quotes can be changed. Some additionnal parameters have been added like the choice of borders styles and colors. It's made by default to behave like the original but you can change more things than before.

You can check out a sample of it [here](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/adquotes/).

## Using it with Before Dawn
This screensaver is already bundled in Before Dawn! Just select "Say No More" in the program's window.

## Using it as standalone web page
- To edit the quotes used, open the file quotes.js and follow the instructions.
- To change the other options, open the file `options.js` and follow the instructions.
